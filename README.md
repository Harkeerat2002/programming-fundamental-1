# Racket Programming Assignments and Projects

This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects written in Racket, a dialect of Lisp. The assignments are part of a programming course or self-study and are organized in separate directories and files.

## Directory Structure

- `Assignments`: Contains individual assignments, each in its own subdirectory or file.
- `Chess Game`: Contains a Racket file `chess.rkt` and a `photos` directory, suggesting it's a project to implement a chess game.
- `Example Programs`: Contains example Racket programs, possibly provided as part of a course or for self-study.
- `Racket`: Contains more Racket files, including assignments and examples.
- `The Design Recipe`: Might contain resources or assignments related to the Design Recipe, a systematic method for designing programs.

## Running Racket (.rkt) Files

To run a `.rkt` file, you need to have Racket installed on your machine. Here's a general step-by-step guide:

1. Install Racket. You can download it from the official website: https://download.racket-lang.org/
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `.rkt` file using the `cd` command.
4. Run the file using the `racket` command followed by the file name. For example, if your file is named `program.rkt`, you would type `racket program.rkt`.

Please note that some programs may require additional steps to run, such as installing specific Racket packages or setting up a specific environment.
